# Default Choices

Examples of widely accepted choices: data access layer, scrum, separate UI from other logic (MVVM?), using a framework (e.g. an MVC framework, but also mocking library)

# Values

Kent Beck has some written up - examine them.

# Simplicity

- what is and what is not "simple".
- 4 rules of simple design - Beck and Shalloway's version
- overdesign
- underdesign

# Enablers

Martin Fowler describes enablers, e.g. self testing code, good quality code

# Code Qualities

- cohesion
- coupling
- redundancy
- readability
- encapsulation (2 definitions)
- testability

# control styles vs code qualities

# Abstractions

- What is "abstraction"
- different abstraction of the same thing in different contexts
- Deriving abstractions
- Naming abstractions
- Modelling abstractions

# SOLID

# Domain Specific Languages

- only embedded, techniques for creating them, examples, compositionality

# GOF guidelines

# Message passing

- internet, OO code
 
# Law of demeter

- differences between it and Tell don't ask

# web of objects vs other paradigms

- procedural
- functional

# Constraints

Apart from enabling flexibility, we strive for constraints to take advantage of mechanisms such as strong typing. A Singleton introduces flexibility but adds constraints at the same time. Sometimes we implement constraints on domain level to get better error handling even though another mechanism ensures we get only the valid data. https://twitter.com/przemekpokrywka/status/730872309683261442
