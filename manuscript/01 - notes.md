# Default Choices

Examples of widely accepted choices: data access layer, scrum, separate UI from other logic (MVVM?), using a framework (e.g. an MVC framework, but also mocking library)

# Simplicity

- what is and what is not "simple".
- overdesign
- underdesign

# Code Qualities

- cohesion
- coupling
- redundancy
- readability
- encapsulation (2 definitions)
- testability

# control styles vs code qualities

# SOLID

# GOF guidelines

# Message passing

- internet, OO code

# web of objects vs other paradigms

- procedural
- functional

# Constraints

Apart from enabling flexibility, we strive for constraints to take advantage of mechanisms such as strong typing. A Singleton introduces flexibility but adds constraints at the same time. Sometimes we implement constraints on domain level to get better error handling even though another mechanism ensures we get only the valid data.
